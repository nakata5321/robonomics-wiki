You don't need USB adapter, so disconnect wires from it.\n\n![disconnect](./images/sensors-connectivity/2_assembly_usb.jpg)\n\nYou may connect it to ESP via connecting wires \"Female-Male\":\n\n![f-m](./images/sensors-connectivity/3_conn.jpg)\n\nAnd connect them to your ESP according to the connection diagram.\n\nOr you can use wires from USB adapter. Disconnect one wire: push on it with some sharp object and carefully pull the wire:\n\n![extreme_con](./images/sensors-connectivity/4_assembly_wires.jpg)\n\nInsert it to last connector:\n\n![extr](./images/sensors-connectivity/5_wires1.jpg)\n\nThen cut the connector in the middle:\n\n![cut](./images/sensors-connectivity/6_assembly_wires2.jpg)\n\nAnd connect them to ESP according to the diagram:\n\n![esp_con](./images/sensors-connectivity/6_esp_con.jpg)\n\n---\n## Device Firmware\nDownload `airrohr-flasher` from the [latest release](https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity/releases) for your OS. \nConnect ESP to computer via micro-USB and run flasher. \n\n### For Linux:\nFirstly you need to add the user to `dialout` group:\n```bash\nsudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER\n```\nThen logout and login or restart computer.\n\nNow you can run flasher (don't forget to give it permission to execute):\n```bash\nchmod +x airrohr-flasher-linux\n./airrohr-flasher-linux\n```\n---\n### For windows:\nUnpack flasher and run it with double click.\n\n---\nChoose firmware (English or Russian) and press upload. It will take a few minutes.\n\n![flasher](./images/sensors-connectivity/7_flasher.jpg)\n\n---\n## Configuration\nReboot your ESP (simply reconnect USB to computer).\nThen connect to airRohr--xxxxxxx Wi-Fi network and in your browser write address 192.168.4.1:\n\n![menu](./images/sensors-connectivity/8_menu1.jpg)\n\nGo to Configuration -> Wi-Fi Settings and add the information about your Wi-Fi network:\n\n![config](./images/sensors-connectivity/9_W-fi.jpg)\n\nThen press \"Save configuration and restart\" and ESP will be connected to the provided Wi-Fi network.\n\n![save](./images/sensors-connectivity/10_save.jpg)\n\n---\nThen find ESP in local network (for that your computer and ESP must be in one network). You can do it using airrohr-flasher. Run it, go to the Discovery tab and press Refresh, then you'll be able to see the address.\n\n![addr](./images/sensors-connectivity/11_flaser2.jpg)\n\n---\n\nOpen ESP local address in your browser, go to Configuration and click 'API Robonomics'. \n\n![robonomics](./images/sensors-connectivity/12_APIrobonomics.jpg)\n\nThen enable GPS, put in your coordinates. Also enable all the sensors you connected:\n\n![gps](./images/sensors-connectivity/13_gps.jpg)\n\nThen press \"Save configuration and restart\".\n\n---\n\n## Results\nGo to [sensors.robonomics.network](https://sensors.robonomics.network/#/), and you will see your sensor on the map.\n![map](./images/sensors-connectivity/14_map.jpg)\n\n"}},"context":{}}
